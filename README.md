Fun app I made for Valorant players who need help keeping track of their in-game finances.
Website features Valorant-themed aesthetics and sound effects! (sound fx courtesy of Rocklan on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvj63k2ll4s&t=79s&ab_channel=Rocklan)

The website simulates a normal Valorant game, allowing the user to make round-by-round decisions on what to buy/sell. Currently features all weapons and armor but doesn't include agent abilities.
